When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  if you want to share your work or progress with someone remote repositories are the right choce.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  if changes are made manually
  -- you would know what new code has been added and not get confused.
  -- you might want to read the file before you pull it and add it to your master.
  -- in case you dont want that change, you dont pull it.
