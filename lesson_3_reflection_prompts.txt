When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  if you want to share your work or progress with someone remote repositories are the right choce.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  if changes are made manually
  -- you would know what new code has been added and not get confused.
  -- you might want to read the file before you pull it and add it to your master.
  -- in case you dont want that change, you dont pull it.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  forks: if you want to work independently on a project which is already on git hub you can use 
         fork to make a copy of the repository on your profile.
         further commits on your repository will not change the owners repository

  clones: clones are just a copy of a repository(remote) on your computer(local)

  branches:if you have to test how the code works for a specific change made and not really want
           to loose the previous state, you can create a new branch and then test and experiment on this new branch.
           The code on the master branch remains unaffected  

                     
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
  this way you can compare files and merge conflicts
